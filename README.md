#Berry subtheme.

##This is a subtheme based on the calm aspekt of nature with piece in mind.

###Description
This is a subtheme developed go against the usual light webbpages of the internett. Designed with relaxation and focus
as the key aspects with inspiration from nature to give a calm apperans but still higlight the usfulness of collors not
used as much in modern webbdesign.

It can be tricky to find colors thet complement eachother withot relying on the collors representing black or white as
a common ground.

This subtheme is bult with articles and basic pages in mind, but wouldnt be hard to expand to other page contents. The subtheme also works together with a number of modulem, most of wich dosnt impact the funktionality of the subtheme, the only
module that have any impact on the subtheme is "social media share" wich can be aacquired at https://www.drupal.org/project/social_media.

The workflow was slow at a start when learning drupal, but gor geradually better. The hardest part was to install drupal and making it work on windows, wich didnt wok in the end and i switched to work on Lunux wich made everything much easier.
it was also a bit tricky to learn how twig-files where construkted and how to work with it, I originaly made a ton of changes to the twig-files and essentially tok awya everything that wasnt just regular HTML and had to redo everything in the twig 
files after I was essentially done, now I only need to do verry few changes to the twig-files.

The logo used is my persenal logo with a few changes.

####List of all additional modules used in the projekt:
